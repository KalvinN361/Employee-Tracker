  ## Description
Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). Your assignment this week is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.

  ## Installation
  To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:
  ```
  Download/clone the repository from github and then npm install node and express, mysql, and console.table. 
  ```
  ## Usage
  Run 'npm start' in terminal and follow the prompts!
